The types of classification tasks tackled by different participants in their research were grouped in five categories. These are described below along with a summary of participant responses.

1) Binary classification (36.4%)

2) Small multi-class (3 - 10 classes) classification (50%)

3) Large multi-class (>10 classes) classification (0%)

4) Small multi-label (3 - 10 classes) classification (9.1%)

5) Large multi-label (>10 classes) classification (4.5%)

Small multi-class classification is the most common type of classification problem encountered while no participants reported working on large multi-class classification tasks.
